"""Wake word detection, wrapping OpenWakeWord.

Knows nothing about audio *capture* (see `voice/audio_stream.py`) or what
happens after a wake word fires (that's `main.py`'s job, via a callback).
Its only responsibility: given audio frames, say whether the configured
wake word was just heard.

Model resolution supports two cases:
    - A bundled stock model, referenced by name (e.g. "hey_jarvis") — used
      as a placeholder during development. As of openWakeWord 0.6.0, stock
      models are NOT bundled in the pip package — they're downloaded once
      from GitHub release assets on first use and cached locally
      thereafter. This is a one-time setup download, not runtime cloud
      inference — it doesn't conflict with Iris's offline-first principle,
      but it does mean the very first run needs an internet connection.
    - A custom-trained model, referenced by a full path to a `.onnx` file
      (e.g. a "Hey Iris" model trained via https://openwakeword.com/train).
      This is a drop-in swap: point config at the new file, no code changes,
      no download needed.

We always use the "onnx" inference framework explicitly (rather than
OpenWakeWord's default "tflite") since it has no extra native-runtime
dependency and works identically across Windows/Linux/macOS.
