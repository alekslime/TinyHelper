"""Ties microphone capture, wake word detection, and speech-to-text
together into one runnable service.

This is the piece `main.py` starts and stops. It owns the full pipeline's
lifecycle and reports two kinds of events upward via callbacks:
    - a wake word was detected
    - an utterance was transcribed (or determined to contain no speech)
It does not know what happens after either event (that's main.py's job,
e.g. transitioning Aura's state) — it only runs the pipeline.

Frame routing is mode-based: every microphone frame goes to either the
wake word detector (normal listening) or the active `ListeningSession`
(capturing an utterance right after a wake word fired), never both. This
keeps a single `MicrophoneStream` (and therefore a single open audio
device) shared across both stages instead of needing two.

Transcription runs on a background thread — a Faster-Whisper call can take
a noticeable moment, and it must not block the audio callback thread (which
would drop incoming audio) or the Qt main thread (which would freeze the
UI).
