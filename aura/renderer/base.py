"""Defines the interface every Aura renderer must implement.

Aura is intentionally decoupled from the rest of Iris: the AI/voice/vision
logic only ever talks to an `AuraRenderer`, never to rendering internals.
This means the actual GPU-rendered ambient glow (a later milestone) can be
swapped in behind this interface without touching any other module, and
community-created themes can eventually provide their own renderers.

This file defines structure only — no rendering happens yet. See
`aura/renderer/null_renderer.py` for the current no-op implementation.
