"""A real, visible `AuraRenderer`: a soft ambient glow around the screen
edges, color-coded per `AuraState`, built from an actual Gaussian blur,
tinted with a slowly-rotating multicolor gradient (rather than a flat
color) and cross-faded smoothly between states.

Replaces `NullAuraRenderer` as Iris's default renderer (Milestone 6). Built
as a frameless, click-through, always-on-top top-level widget painted with
QPainter/`QGraphicsBlurEffect` rather than a literal custom GPU shader
pipeline -- see docs/DECISIONS.md for why this still satisfies the
roadmap's "GPU-rendered ambient edge glow" goal without a much heavier
OpenGL/QML dependency.

Visual model (2026-07-13 rewrite, replacing the flat-tint approach; widened
to a full-wheel pastel sweep later the same day):
the blurred edge-band shape is unchanged from the previous version (see
`_build_blurred_mask()`), but instead of re-tinting it to a single flat
color per frame, it's re-tinted with a `QConicalGradient` centered on the
screen: stops sweep through the *entire* hue wheel (+/- 180 degrees around
the current state's base hue -- i.e. all the way around, not a narrow
band), at low saturation/high value so every hue reads as pastel rather
than neon. The gradient's angle continuously rotates, so the effect is a
full-spectrum pastel wash smoothly circling the border. State is still
reflected -- the anchor hue (where the sweep's start/end seam sits) cross-
fades between states (see `_shortest_hue_delta()`) -- but since the sweep
already spans every hue, a state change now reads mainly as a shift in
*which hue is currently at a given angle* rather than a change in the
overall palette, which stays a continuous pastel rainbow throughout.

Design constraints from docs/ROADMAP.md, honored here:
    - State-based color transitions (idle/listening/thinking/waiting/error)
    - Smooth fade in/out, no sharp/harsh edges (Gaussian blur, unchanged)
    - A slow, subtle continuous animation (not a sharp flashing pulse) --
      previously a breathing alpha pulse, now a rotating multicolor
      gradient; see docs/DECISIONS.md for the history of this element.
