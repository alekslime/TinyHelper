"""Screen capture via `mss`.

Knows nothing about vision models, the LLM, or Aura — it takes a screenshot
and hands back an in-memory image. `main.py` (from Milestone 5 onward)
decides when to call it and what to do with the result, same separation of
concerns as `voice/audio_stream.py` and `speech/transcriber.py`.

Privacy by default: `capture()` never writes to disk. The only way a
screenshot touches disk is the explicit `save_debug_screenshots` developer
setting, handled by `capture_and_maybe_save()` — off by default, and never
enabled implicitly. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
