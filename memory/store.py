"""SQLite-backed conversation history (Milestone 9, Part A).

`ConversationStore` persists each query/response turn to a local SQLite
database so a record of past conversations survives across app restarts.

Scope note: this is storage only. Nothing here feeds past turns back into
the LLM prompt -- that's Milestone 9, Part B (retrieval for follow-up
context), a separate piece of work. `get_recent_turns` exists for
inspection/testing, not for prompt construction.

Threading: `save_turn`/`get_recent_turns` each open and close their own
short-lived `sqlite3` connection rather than sharing one across threads.
`main.py` calls `save_turn` from the same worker thread that runs LLM
generation (a new thread per query) -- a shared connection would need
either `check_same_thread=False` plus a lock, or one connection per
thread. A connection per call is simpler and safe: SQLite handles
concurrent short connections to the same file via its own locking, and
turn volume is far too low for per-call connection overhead to matter.
