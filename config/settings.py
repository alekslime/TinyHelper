"""Loads and persists Iris's configuration.

Usage:
    from config.settings import get_settings
    settings = get_settings()
    print(settings.aura.theme)

Load order:
    1. Bundled `config/default_config.yaml` (always present, version controlled).
    2. User's `%APPDATA%/Iris/config/config.yaml` (created on first run, editable).
       Values here override the defaults.

The merged result is validated against `AppSettings` so the rest of the
codebase can trust it is well-formed.
