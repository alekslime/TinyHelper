"""Per-turn latency instrumentation (Milestone 11, Part A).

`main.py`'s pipeline for a single voice turn -- wake word -> STT ->
(optional) vision -> LLM -> TTS -- spans several worker threads and two
Qt-signal hops (WakeWordBridge, TranscriptBridge, LLMResponseBridge,
TTSBridge), so no single function owns start-to-finish timing. `TurnTimer`
is a small, dependency-free stopwatch built to be passed through that
whole chain: one instance is created when a wake word fires and threaded
through as an explicit argument (worker-thread stages) or via the
closure-scoped `current_turn` holder in `main.py` (main-thread callback
stages), the same "single turn at a time" assumption `main.py` already
relies on elsewhere (e.g. `TTSSettings.interrupt_on_new_query` stopping
previous playback when a new query starts).

Two ways to mark a stage, matching the two shapes stages come in:

  1. A stage that starts and ends within one function/thread -- use it as
     a context manager: `with timer.stage("llm"): ...`.
  2. A stage that starts in one callback and ends in a later, different
     callback (e.g. "stt" starts in `on_wake_word_detected`, ends in
     `on_transcribed`) -- call `start_stage()`/`end_stage()` explicitly.

Deliberately stdlib-only (`time.perf_counter()`, `threading.Lock`) --
this needs to work in every configuration (LLM/vision/TTS all
optional/uninstalled), not just when the heavier optional extras are
present.
