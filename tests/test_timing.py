"""Tests for `utils/timing.py`'s `TurnTimer` (Milestone 11, Part A).

Real `time.perf_counter()` calls throughout -- no mocking of time itself,
since these are cheap (millisecond-scale sleeps) and mocking `perf_counter`
would mean testing against a fake clock instead of the real behavior this
module exists to measure. `time.sleep()` durations are kept short but
non-zero so timings are genuinely > 0 and ordering assertions are
meaningful, not just "didn't crash."
