"""Manual, throwaway preview for the Dynamic Island widget (Part A).

This is NOT part of Iris itself and is not wired into main.py -- it just
shows the widget standalone so you can eyeball the real color/frosted-
glass look on an actual monitor before we decide anything about Part B's
real activation triggers (global hotkey / wake word).

Run it directly:

    python preview_island_manual_check.py

Controls:
    Space   toggle collapsed <-> expanded
    Esc     quit

Safe to delete once you've had a look -- it'll be superseded by real
activation wiring in Part B.
