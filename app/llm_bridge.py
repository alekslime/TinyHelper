"""Bridges LLM generation results from the background inference thread to
Qt's main/GUI thread. Same pattern as `app/transcript_bridge.py` and
`app/wake_word_bridge.py` — see those files' docstrings for why this
matters.

Generation runs on its own worker thread (not the Qt main thread) because
it can take anywhere from under a second to many seconds depending on
hardware and model size, and the GUI must not block on it.
