"""Standalone vision pipeline diagnostic for Iris.

Run this directly (not through main.py). Two modes:

  1. describe() sanity check -- what ScreenCapture grabs, what it looks
     like shrunk to ~encoder-tile size, and what VisionModel.describe()
     says about each. (Legacy from Milestone 5.)

  2. locate() sample-gathering mode -- the current priority (see
     HANDOFF.md: locate() is disabled pending real evidence of what its
     raw output actually means). For each target you pass on the command
     line, this calls VisionModel.locate() with verbose=True so
     llama.cpp's own internal "nx="/"ny=" resize-geometry lines print
     alongside the raw JSON, saves an annotated copy of the screenshot
     with two candidate interpretations of the box drawn on it (percent-
     of-image, and pixel-in-resized-space), and dumps everything to
     locate_samples.jsonl so multiple runs/targets can be compared later.

CORRECTION (see HANDOFF.md): the vision model actually loaded here is
MiniCPM-V-2.6 (see vision/model.py + docs/DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-13
entries), NOT Qwen2.5-VL-3B as some earlier notes claimed, and NOT
moondream2 as this script used to say. Comments below are corrected
accordingly -- don't reintroduce the moondream2/Qwen2.5-VL references.

Usage:
    python test_vision.py                      # describe() sanity check only
    python test_vision.py locate "the save button" "the clock"
                                                 # locate() sample-gathering,
                                                 # one screenshot, N targets
